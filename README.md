## How DevOps Improves Software Delivery

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

According to our textbook, DevOps promotes collaboration between developers and operations teams, enabling faster and more reliable software deployment. This leads to reduced time-to-market, improved product quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction. Automation, monitoring, continuous integration, and continuous deployment are core principles that support this approach.

By integrating these practices, organizations can respond more quickly to user needs, fix bugs rapidly, and build scalable systems efficiently.
